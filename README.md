## What is this abomination?
RSSenger is an instant messenging webapp that uses *valid* rss feeds as the primary storage method for anything that i could cram into a feed.  


### Horrible ideas ive had in mind
* rss-ify all the stylesheets. No promises on whether or not this will happen

### Less horrible ideas ive had in mind
* Spend some time either finding or creating a vulnerability so that it can be used in ctfs

## Installation
1) Create a users feed by copying `template.xml` to `users.xml`
2) Modify settings to your liking in `settings.xml`

### Do not delete `template.xml`. It is used for new feeds as well

Tada! You're done.
